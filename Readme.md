# GLSL Shader Viewer

This program opens an OpenGL window at a specified resolution and renders an animated GLSL shader. It's lightweight, simple to set up, and great for shader development.

## Prerequisites

- Python **3.13.0** or later.
- A modern graphics driver with OpenGL support.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the program to launch the OpenGL window and render the shader:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Customization

- Adjust the resolution and shader settings in the configuration file or script as needed.
- Replace the shader file with your own GLSL shader to experiment with custom animations.
- mess around with the glsl shader to see how it works.
